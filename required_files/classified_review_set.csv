8098,"A coil spring clutch connects a driving hub to a driven sleeve rotatable on the hub and the sleeve drives an output or second driven member through a torque limiting clutch. The spring is readily declutched by arresting rotation of its leading end, as by interposing a stop in the path of an out-turned tang on that end, and is re-engaged by releasing the leading end. Re-engagement is characteristically abrupt and harsh, and the torque-limiting clutch in series with the spring clutch limits torque stress on the spring so that the series assembly is usable in applications which would destroy the spring clutch alone. The torque-limiting clutch may be a fully-releasable centrifugal clutch, in which case, the spring declutching mechanism may be actuated in common with or in response to application of a brake to stop the second driven member, or may be a frictionally-engaged centrifugal clutch or a spring-biased friction clutch.
